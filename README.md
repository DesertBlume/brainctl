# brainctl
```
**brainctl** is a modular automation framework designed to orchestrate infrastructure provisioning, validation, and scoring — all driven by natural language.

At its core, brainctl connects three powerful layers:

- **Rick's Brain**: A natural language interface that receives questions or commands and routes them to appropriate skills.
- **Worker Rick**: A backend logic engine that executes skills like semantic search, summarization, and deployment coordination.
- **Infrastructure Pipeline**:
  - **Ansible**: For deploying and configuring services
  - **Go Validator**: For testing and validating infrastructure state
  - **Scoring**: For quantifying and analyzing validation output

All of this is triggered and coordinated through a chatbot interface, making DevOps more human and intelligent.

## Example Skills

- `search:` – Semantic search through local notes or knowledge base
- `summarize:` – Text summarization for large outputs
- `help:` – Lists all available commands
- `deploy:` – Triggers Ansible playbook execution (planned)
- `validate:` – Runs Go-based verification pipeline (planned)

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:DesertBlume/brainctl.git
cd brainctl

# (Optional) Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (located in the project root)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Rick's Brain
python3 rick_brain/main.py

````

---

## Testing

```bash
# Generate unit tests for new skills
python3 generate_tests.py

# Run all tests
pytest
```

## Project Philosophy

> Infrastructure should listen before it acts.

**brainctl** turns high-level intent ("Deploy the DNS server") into verified, scored outcomes — all without writing a shell script or opening a dashboard. It’s built to empower automation with intelligence, clarity, and trust.

---

## Roadmap

* [x] Natural language routing (`Rick's Brain`)
* [x] Modular skill system (`Worker Rick`)
* [x] Auto-generated skill tests
* [x] Pre-commit hooks for test enforcement
* [ ] Ansible deployment trigger via skill
* [ ] Go-based infrastructure validation and scoring
* [ ] CLI and web UI interface options
